# Predict-Flight-Delay-based-on-Weather-Data-main
The Goal of project is Predict airline delays caused by inclement weather conditions using data mining & supervised machine learning algorithms.Flight & weather data from 2005 to 2015 were extracted to train model. 
solution: To overcome the eﬀect of unbalanced training data. sampling techniques are applied & implemented to build models which can predict delays of ﬂight. 
Result: found that AdaBoost performed best with precision 88% recall > 90%.
